## Roadmap

The AeroGear OAuth2 effort started out of a POC and we are now moving towards a first release. 

[List of 1.0.0 JIRA tickets](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/AGSEC-180)

## Development

Below are the various GitHub repositories that are part of the OAuth2 feature in AeroGear.

### Android

The [AeroGear Android Authz](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-authz) will give developers the ability to integrate their Android application with RESTful services secured with OAuth2.

### iOS

On iOS we do have a Swift based OAuth2 client [library](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-oauth2).

### Windows

For Windows we have a client library for OAuth2 on [Windows phone](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-windows-oauth2).

### Apache Cordova

Our [Apache Cordova plugin](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-oauth2-cordova) for OAuth2 supports the following platforms:

* Android
* iOS
* Windows

## Demo applications 

We have a demo application, called _Shoot'n Share_ for all of our supported platforms (Android, iOS, Windows and Cordova). The application allows you to upload a photo to Facebook, Google+ or a Keycloak protected backend.

The different applications can be found it the platform specific _cookbooks_:

* [Android Shoot'n Share](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-android-cookbook/tree/master/ShootAndShare)
* [iOS Shoot'n Share](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-ios-cookbook/tree/master/Shoot)
* [Windows Shoot'n Share](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-windows-cookbook/blob/master/Shoot/README.md)
* [Cordova Shoot'n Share](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-cordova-cookbook/tree/master/Shoot)

The Keycloak protected backend application is a simple Java EE / JAX-RS based application. The source is located [here](https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-backend-cookbook/tree/master/Shoot).
