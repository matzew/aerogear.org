Administration of the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server
-------------------------------------------------------

The Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server is protected by link:http://keycloak.org[Keycloak SSO server]. This document explains few features from the **Keycloak Admin Console** to perform some administrative configurations around the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server and its users.

Login and Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After exploring Admin UI of the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, it is time to become familiar with the _Keycloak Admin Console_, which is located at:

+http(s)://SERVER:PORT/auth/admin/aerogear/console/index.html+

After being logged in successfully using your admin account, you see an overview of general settings:

image::./img/kc/LandingPage_KC_Admin.png[General Settings]

WARNING: Do _**not**_ disable, rename or even delete the +aerogear+ realm. This will make the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server _unusable_.

Besides the general overview, the _Keycloak Admin Console_ offers various configuration settings, such as _Login_, _Roles_, _Default Roles_, _Credentials_, _Keys_, _Email_, _Themes_ or
_Cache Config_.

NOTE: In this guide we cover only these that are relevant for the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server

For instance, in the _Login Settings_ you can tweak the actual login to the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, like enabling a _Remember Me_ checkbox:

image::./img/kc/RememberMe_enabling.png[Enable RememberMe]

This will result in a slightly different login screen for the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, where a _Remember Me_ checkbox is presented underneath the +password+ field:

image::./img/kc/RememberMe_enabled_UPS.png[Active RememberMe function]

Another item that could be configured is the _Forgot password_ function, if one of your users (link:#_user_management[see below]) forgot his password. However, this requires configuration details for your own SMTP server, to enable Keycloak sending emails to your users:

User Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To manage users for the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, you need to go to the +Users+ section of the _Keycloak Admin Console_:

image::./img/kc/User_overview.png[User Management Overview]

To see the list of all existing users, click on the +View all users+ link:

image::./img/kc/Users_list.png[List of existing Users]

Enabling the default developer account
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To enable the default +developer+ account, click on its username in the above screen, to edit the account:

image::./img/kc/edit_developer.png[Edit default developer account]

After toggling the +User Enabled+ button to +ON+, click the +Save+ button to activate the +developer+ account.

Adding new users
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add new users for the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, go back to the +Users+ section of the _Keycloak Admin Console_:

image::./img/kc/User_overview.png[User Management Overview]

Next you click the +Add User+ button in the above screen, which brings you to the _Add User_ form:

image::./img/kc/User_add.png[Add new User]

In this dialog you provide the information such as email or first and last name. However, the username is a mandatory field.

NOTE: Please make sure you keep the user enabled, otherwise a login is not possible.

Once you click +Save+, the screen reloads and the unique user ID is visible:

image::./img/kc/User_added.png[Added new User]

Next you can give the new user a temporary password. This option is provided in the +Credentials+ option:

image::./img/kc/User_tmp_password.png[Provide a temporary password]

Once you enter the initial (or temporary) password, you need to confirm the _reset_:

image::./img/kc/User_tmp_password_confirm.png[Confirm temporary password]

NOTE: The password of any user can be resetted all the time, using this feature. Afterwards the user is asked to update the password you used in the above dialog.

On the +Role Mappings+ option you must assign the required role to the new created user:

image::./img/kc/User_role_config.png[Select the required admin role]

Choose the +developer+ role from the +Available Roles+ list. Once selected, shuffle it over to the +Assigned Roles+ list:

image::./img/kc/User_role_configured.png[Configured role settings]

NOTE: Using the shuffle component automatically saves the selection.

At this point the new user is able to use the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server.

In the +Sessions+ option you can monitor the active sessions of a specific user:

image::./img/kc/User_sessions_overview.png[Active sessions of a specific user]

This dialog allows you to +logout+ a specific session of the user or all sessions using the +Logout All Sessions+ button above the table.

Active Sessions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the +Sessions and Tokens+ section of the _Keycloak Admin Console_ you can monitor all active sessions against the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server's realm, as well as providing configurations around access tokens or timeouts.

The +Realm Sessions+ option allows you to perform a logout for _all_ active sessions:

image::./img/kc/Session_Tokens_overview.png[All active sessions]

On the +Timeout Settings+ option you can override the default settings for session timeouts or different token lifespans:

image::./img/kc/Session_Timeout_Settings.png[Timeout configuration]

NOTE: For security reasons the default timeout values for the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server are pretty conservative. Be careful when you are increasing them.

On the +Revocation Policies+ section, you can specify the _Not-before_ revocation policies per realm, application, or user, and _push_ this value to the client adapters that have an admin URL set up:

image::./img/kc/Session_Revocation_Policies.png[Revocation Policies]

Security Defenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default +Brute Force Protection+ is disabled. You can enable it by navigating to +Security Defenses > Brute Force Protection+ and clicking the +Enabled+ button:

image::./img/kc/Session_Enable_BruteForce.png[Enable Brute Force]

With _Brute Force Protection_ enabled, your Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server gains more security features. The above form gives you options to configure different times and options for attempts to perform a login, and how often.

Next Steps
~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you are familiar with the two admin user interfaces of the Red Hat JBoss Unified Push Server, it is time to get some mobile development started! You can find a list of different tutorials and guides link:../next[here].
