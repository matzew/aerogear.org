Creating an iOS application
---------------------------


Before we start, please install link:http://cocoapods.org/[CocoaPods].


Afterwards, please clone this link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-ios-demo[Sample Application]. It uses our SDK to register your application installation with the iOS Variant you registered earlier!

Sample App
~~~~~~~~~~

Once the application is on your filesystem, invoke the following command:

[source,c]
----
pod install
----

This downloads the project dependencies (e.g. our little SDK) and creates a Workspace, which you need to open in order to work with the Application. In the same folder invoke

[source,c]
----
open PushTest.xcworkspace
----

Once the project is opened in Xcode, you need to change the *Bundle ID*, since it *has* to match the one that you created earlier:

Further, ensure that the correct *Provisioning profile* is set on the application:

Setting up the iOS Variant ID
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now it is time to look at the code: Open the link:https://github.com/aerogear/aerogear-push-ios-demo/blob/master/PushTest/AGAppDelegate.m[AGAppDelegate file]. Here we have removed all the unneeded boilerplate code, in order to focus on getting the _Apple Push Notifications_ to work. The _application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:_ method contains a call to the _registerForRemoteNotificationTypes_ to notify the operating system, that this app is interested in different types of _Remote Notifications_:


[source,c]
----
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    
// Let the device know we want to receive push notifications
 [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:
  (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
...
...
...
----

__Note:__ Since iOS8 _registerForRemoteNotificationTypes_ has been removed in favor of _registerUserNotificationSettings_. Besides, for remote push notification you will need the extra step to call _registerForRemoteNotifications_. If you want to offer support for both iOS7 and iOS8, you can use this code snippet:

[source,c]
----
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {

// when running under iOS 8 we will use the new API for APNS registration
#if __IPHONE_OS_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED >= 80000
    if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {
        UIUserNotificationSettings* notificationSettings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound categories:nil];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerUserNotificationSettings:notificationSettings];
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotifications];
    } else {
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];
    }
#else
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: (UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound | UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert)];

#endif
...
----

Once the application is started the _FIRST_ time, it generates the following dialog, where the user has to agree that the application _may_ receive "Push Notification Messages":


image:./img/PushDialog.png[iOS Push Dialoag]

Once the user agrees, Push Messages can be received by the app!


After making sure the user is asked to agree on receiving Push Messages, we need to implement the _application: didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:_ from the _UIApplicationDelegate_ protocol. This is callback is _ALWAYS_ invoked when the user is allowing _Push Notifications_. It basically delegates the _DeviceToken_, that your device and the _Apple Push Network Service_ negotiated, to _AeroGear Push Server_ so that it can store it in a "Database" and use it to send messages to it. The _deviceToken_ basically identifies THIS phone with _APNs_.


_Note: Mostly the token stays the same, but there are cases when it may change..._


Now let's look at the important code section:

[source,c]
----
- (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken {
    
    // initialize "Registration helper" object using the
    // base URL where the "AeroGear UnifiedPush Server" is running.

    AGDeviceRegistration *registration =    // [1]
    
        // WARNING: make sure, you start JBoss with the -b 0.0.0.0 option, to bind on all interfaces
        // from the iPhone, you can NOT use localhost 
        [[AGDeviceRegistration alloc] initWithServerURL:[NSURL URLWithString:@"http://192.168.0.102:8080/ag-push/"]];  
    
    [registration registerWithClientInfo:^(id<AGClientDeviceInformation> clientInfo) {   // [2]
        
        // You need to fill the 'Variant Id' together with the 'Variant Secret'
        // both received when performing the variant registration with the server.
        [clientInfo setVariantID:@"402880e63ea239b9013ea23be9dc0004"];  // [3]
        [clientInfo setVariantSecret:@"45d23ff4-cba4-49f2-ab91-6ba5fd7d23b4"];  // [4]

        // apply the token, to identify THIS device
        [clientInfo setDeviceToken:deviceToken];  // [5]

        // --optional config--
        // set some 'useful' hardware information params
        UIDevice *currentDevice = [UIDevice currentDevice];
        
        [clientInfo setOperatingSystem:[currentDevice systemName]];  // [6]
        [clientInfo setOsVersion:[currentDevice systemVersion]];     // [7]
        [clientInfo setDeviceType: [currentDevice model]];           // [8]
        
    } success:^() {
        
        // successfully registered!

    } failure:^(NSError *error) {
        // did receive an HTTP error from the UPS server ???
        // Let's log it for now:
        NSLog(@"UPS registration Error: %@", error);
    }];
}
----

In [1] we initialize our _AGDeviceRegistration_ object. **NOTE:** You can not use _localhost_ from the device, you have to use an (internal) IP address, where the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ is running!

Next, in [2] we call _registerWithClientInfo_ passing a configuration block that sets up the parameters needed to register this app with the _AeroGear Push Server_. The required parameters that need to be present are the _VariantID_ [3] and _VariantSecret_ [4]  (which we received it in the previous chapter when we were registering the _iOS Variant_ with the _Push Application_) and the Device Token [5]. It is valid to specify a bit more data on the _clientInfo_ and we do here by setting metadata such the operating system [6], its version [7] and the device type [8].

[NOTE]
Do not forget to use the _development_ _VariantID_ and _VariantSecret_ if you are using your _development_ provisioning profile as your signing identity in Xcode, or to use _production_ _VariantID_ and _VariantSecret_ if you are using your _distribution_ provisioning profile.)

Callbacks
^^^^^^^^^

The _success_ callback is invoked, when the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_ was able to register your device with the given _iOS Variant_. Otherwise the _failure_ callback would be invoked. One case could be a wrong IP address....


The _application: didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:_ would be invoked if there is a problem in receving a token from _APNs_...


Test the app on your device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now run the phone on the device. After agreeing on receiving Push Messages, you will see another Dialog, that welcomes you! Now put the app into the background, by clicking the home button.


Sending messages to the device
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The last chapter shows how to link:../send-push[send messages] to the device, using the _AeroGear UnifiedPush Server_!
